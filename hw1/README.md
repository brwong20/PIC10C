Assignment 1 - 'Siete y Medio'

Descrption
----------
Program that allows us to play a single-player version of the card game
'Siete y medio' which is the Spanish version of Blackjack. Instead of playing 
with classic poker cards and trying to get as close to 21 as possible, you play with 'Spanish baraja' and the goal is 7.5 instead.
